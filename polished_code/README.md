### Linear Support Vector Classification

![](linearsvm.png?raw=true "")

Linear SVM is a Machine Learning algorithm used for solving classification problems. This code implements Linear SVM with l2 regularization penalty. We have also implemented the cross-validation to find the optimal value of lambda.

We have two demo files that allows a user to launch the method, visualize the training process, and print the performance on a real-world dataset and a simple simulated dataset.

We also have a file which allows a user to run an experimental comparison between our implementation and scikit-learnâ€™s on the real-world dataset.
